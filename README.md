# responsive-portfolio

- This is a project that worked on introducing myself, my projects, through html, css, and bootstrap.
- The project works with three different types of html pages, one involving pictures and a description, another with a display of the gallery of projects, and the last is a form that allows users to contact me.
- This project includes a responsive set of pages with a navigation bar, and footnote.
